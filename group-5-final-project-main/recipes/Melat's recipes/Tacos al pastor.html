            <h1>Tacos Al Pastor</h1>
            <h6>By Melat Berhe</h6>
            <p>Tacos Al Pastor is a traditional Mexican dish featuring marinated pork that is typically grilled or roasted on a vertical spit. The pork is seasoned with a blend of spices such as dried chilies, garlic, cumin, and oregano, along with vinegar and pineapple juice for tanginess and sweetness.</p>

    <div id="procedure">
        <h2>PROCEDURE:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the stems and seeds from the dried guajillo and ancho chilies.</li>
            <li>Place them in a bowl and cover them with hot water.</li>
            <li>Let them soak for about 20 minutes until they soften.</li>
            <li>While the chilies are soaking, cut the pork shoulder into thin slices or strips.</li>
            <li>In a blender or food processor, combine the soaked chilies (drained), pineapple juice, white vinegar, garlic, chopped onion, ground cumin, dried oregano, smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, ground cloves, ground cinnamon, and cayenne pepper (if using).</li>
            <li>Blend until you have a smooth marinade.</li>
            <li>Place the sliced pork shoulder in a large bowl or resealable plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Pour the marinade over the pork and toss to coat it evenly.</li>
            <li>Make sure all the pork slices are well coated.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl or seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to develop.</li>
            <li>Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. If using a grill pan, you may need to lightly grease it with oil.</li>
            <li>Remove the marinated pork from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature for about 15-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, cook the marinated pork slices for about 2-3 minutes on each side until they are nicely browned and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked pork to a plate and cover it to keep it warm.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process until all the pork is cooked.</li>
            <li>While the pork is cooking, warm the corn tortillas.</li>
            <li>You can do this by wrapping them in a clean kitchen towel and microwaving them for a few seconds or by heating them on a dry skillet over medium heat for about 30 seconds on each side.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Tacos al Pastor by placing a few slices of cooked pork on each warm tortilla.</li>
            <li>You can top them with chopped pineapple, chopped onion, chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve the Tacos al Pastor immediately and enjoy!</li>
