                <li>1 clove garlic</li>
                <li>4 dried chile peppers</li>
                <li>2 cups water</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) package dried corn husks</li>
                <li>⅔ cup lard</li>
                <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth, or as needed</li>
                <li>2 cups masa harina</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            </ul>

    <div id="procedure">
            <h2>PROCEDURE:</h2>
            <ol>
                    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Make the filling: Place pork, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven. Add<br> enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and <br>simmer until pork is cooked through, about 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, make chile sauce: Use rubber gloves to remove stems<br> and seeds from chiles. Place chiles in a saucepan with 2 cups water.<br> Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.</li>
                    <li>Transfer chiles and cooking water to a blender and blend until<br> smooth. Strain mixture into a bowl and stir in salt. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Shred cooked pork and mix in 1 cup chile sauce. Reserve remaining<br> sauce for serving.</li>
                    <li>Prepare husks and dough: Soak corn husks in a bowl of warm water<br> until softened, about 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While the husks are soaking, beat lard with 1 tablespoon broth until<br> fluffy.</li>
                    <li>Combine masa harina, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; <br> stir into the lard mixture, adding more broth as needed to form a<br> spongy dough.</li>
                    <li>Remove husks from water and pat dry. Spread dough out over <br> husks to 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick.</li>
                    <li>Place 1 tablespoon pork filling over center of each. Fold the sides, <br> top, and bottom of each husks in toward the center to enclose<br>dough.</li>
                    <li>Arrange tamales in a steamer basket. Place over simmering water and steam for 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>Remove tamales from husks. Drizzle with remaining chile sauce <br>and top with sour cream, or mix sour cream into chile sauce first for<br> a creamy sauce.</li>
                    <li>Serve with  your favorites sides, enjoy!</li>
